Transaction origin privacy is the ability to hide the origin of a transaction from network surveillance.

If an eavesdropper can see every transaction relayed by every node, they
can assume that the first node to send a transaction is the node where
that transaction originated.  This implies that someone at that node’s
IP address created that transaction.  Whether that implication is
correct or not, this capability is harmful to user privacy.

Even when surveillance of the entire Bitcoin network is not possible,
there are many methods for attempting to locate which node originated a
transaction.  Developers have expended significant effort on improving
transaction origin privacy.  Some previous and ongoing efforts include:


  
    ● Lightning Network: although onchain LN transactions still need
transaction origin privacy, offchain LN payments that are routed
through onion-encrypted messages are more resistant to many of the
techniques applied against onchain Bitcoin transactions.
  
  
    ● Anonymity networks: support has been added
to Bitcoin Core for encrypted relay of transaction and other data over
Tor, I2P, and CJDNS.  Several other Bitcoin programs support some or
all of these protocols.  Encryption makes it much more difficult for
an eavesdropper to reliably determine the origin of a transaction.
  
  
    ● v2 P2P transport: this protocol will provide
native encryption of transaction and other data for Bitcoin programs.
  
  
    ● Dandelion: this protocol will allow a node which
did not originate a transaction to be the first to publicly broadcast
it, potentially making it much more difficult to determine the actual
origin.  Dandelion will be much more effective if it is combined with
encryption, either naively or through anonymity networks.
  
  
    ● Mempool rebroadcast: the Bitcoin protocol can’t provide any
assurance to wallets that their unconfirmed transactions have been received
by honest nodes and miners.  This means wallets may need to
periodically rebroadcast unconfirmed transactions.  Every rebroadcast
increases the opportunity for a surveillant to determine which IP
address originated the transaction.  Bitcoin Core developers have been
working on having all nodes periodically rebroadcast some unconfirmed
transactions from their mempools so that it won’t be clear whether a
rebroadcast was initiated by a wallet involved in the transaction or
just some random node.  Rebroadcast may also have other beneficial
effects beyond privacy.
