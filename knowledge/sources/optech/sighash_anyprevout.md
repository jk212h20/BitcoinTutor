Also covering SIGHASH_NOINPUT

SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT, an updated version of SIGHASH_NOINPUT, is a proposal for a signature hash (sighash) where the identifier for the UTXO being spent is not signed, allowing the signature to be used with any UTXO that’s protected by a similar script (i.e. uses the same public keys).

A noinput-style sighash is necessary for the proposed eltoo
layer for LN.
