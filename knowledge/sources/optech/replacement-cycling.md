Replacement cycling is an attack against CPFP fee bumps and transactions using SIGHASH_SINGLE that allows an attacker to remove an unconfirmed transaction from the mempools of relaying full nodes without leaving an alternative transaction in its place.  It mainly affects multiparty transactions that depend on CPFP fee bumps, such as those used in LN.

Mallory and Bob may share funds, as in an LN channel.  Each of them has a
unilateral exit transaction (such as an LN commitment transaction)
that they can publish onchain at any time to terminate the fund sharing
arrangement.  To allow either of them to fee bump the transaction, it
contains at least one output each of them can spend in a child
transaction for a CPFP fee bump.

If Bob wants to terminate the fund sharing, he can broadcast his
unilateral exit transaction along with a child transaction for the CPFP
fee bump.  Mallory has the
ability to broadcast her own unilateral exit transaction with a
higher-fee child transaction.  Because the two exit transactions spend the same
inputs, they conflict, and Bob’s lower-fee exit transaction will be
replaced in mempools with Mallory’s higher-fee alternative.
That’s fine for Bob: in the protocol, he doesn’t care which exit
transaction gets confirmed—either transaction will end the fund
sharing arrangement.

However, after Mallory’s alternative exit transaction has entered
mempools, she can replace her child transaction with another conflicting
transaction—this one with no relationship to either exit transaction.
This replacement removes Mallory’s alternative transaction, leaving the
mempool devoid of any transaction that terminates the fund sharing
arrangement.



Bob can broadcast his exact same exit transaction and child transaction from
before, but Mallory can repeat the sequence of steps to remove his
transaction from mempools—although she’ll need to use a different UTXO
or pay a higher feerate to reuse the same input each time.  The cycle of
Bob rebroadcasting and Mallory re-removing is what presumably gives
replacement cycling its name.

Replacement cycling is especially concerning in protocols that use time
sensitive transactions.  For example, forwarded HTLCs in
LN must be resolved within a certain number of blocks.  If Mallory is
able to use replacement cycling to prevent Bob from resolving HTLCs
forwarded to Mallory within a certain amount of time, Mallory can steal
from Bob.

Several mitigations for replacement have been deployed by LN implementations.  Possibly the most
effective mitigation is a combination of Bob frequently rebroadcasting
and the use of longer timeouts in protocols such as HTLCs (e.g.
increasing the CLTV expiry delta in LN).
Additional mitigations have been proposed.



Any transaction that can be replaced in the mempool by a counterparty or
third party is potentially vulnerable to replacement cycling if any of
the replacement transactions spend an input under the control of the
attacker.
