    Version 2 P2P transport
    
  

  
    




Also covering BIP151 and BIP324

Version 2 (v2) P2P transport is a proposal to allow Bitcoin nodes to communicate with each other over encrypted connections.

Some other changes to the communication protocol are also suggested,
such as allowing frequently-used protocol commands to be aliased to
shorted byte sequences to reduce bandwidth.

This proposal replaces the earlier BIP151 proposal.
